        <div>Hiddenhistory was first made in early September 2017, when during history class, it's founder was intrigued by
            the historical figures that were being presented; from almost comical stories such as that of a chinese man who thought he was jesus, 
            raised an army, and managed to defeat the actual emperor in multiple battles, to tragic ones, such as Leopold's Congo.
            He liked the idea of presenting history, and a couple of months later, decided to start a youtube channel.
